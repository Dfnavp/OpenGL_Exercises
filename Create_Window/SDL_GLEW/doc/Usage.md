# SDL+GLEW Window

> [!NOTE]
> This exercise serves as a starting template for the [WikiBooks' OpenGL Programming series.](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming)

For this exercise, CMake uses the SDL and GLEW packages that are installed in the system.

> [!TIP]
> In case of not having these packages, run the following command in your terminal to install them:
> ``sudo dnf install glew-devel SDL2-devel SDL2_image-devel glm-devel freetype-devel``

To build this exercise, navigate to the *build/* directory and run the following commands in your terminal:

``cmake ..``

``make``

If everything works correctly, you should now see an executable file called *Window_SDL*.
